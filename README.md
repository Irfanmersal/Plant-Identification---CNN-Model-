# Plant-Identification---CNN-Model
This project aims to classify leaves using traditional handcrafted features and features extracted from pre-trained deep CNNs. The input to our system is raw images from a dataset and the output is the label for each species. By the end of the project, we should be able to predict a plant species by taking in a leaf image from the user.

# How to Run the Application 
1 ) Install all the Requirements /n
2 ) Create a Envieronment to play the python file 
3 ) open Terminal type - Streamit run app.py
4 ) upload only Gives images from Datasets ( its trained Dataset from Kaggle )
