# Plant-Identification---CNN-Model
This project aims to classify leaves using traditional handcrafted features and features extracted from pre-trained deep CNNs. The input to our system is raw images from a dataset and the output is the label for each species. By the end of the project, we should be able to predict a plant species by taking in a leaf image from the user.
